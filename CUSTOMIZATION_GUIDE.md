### 2. Change Personality/Instructions (agent.py Lines 106-125)

This section controls everything the agent says and how it behaves.

**Example: Simple friendly caller**
```python
instructions=f"""
You are a friendly and helpful assistant calling to check in with clients.
Your interface with users will be voice.

Keep your responses brief and natural. Speak like a real person, not a robot.
Be warm and personable. The client's name is {name}.

Your goal is to have a pleasant conversation and answer any questions they may have.
"""
```

**Example: Professional appointment reminder**
```python
instructions=f"""
You are calling to confirm an appointment.
Your interface with users will be voice.

You are professional, efficient, and friendly.
Keep the call brief - your goal is to:
1. Greet the client by name ({name})
2. Confirm they have an appointment at {appointment_time}
3. Ask if they can still make it
4. Thank them and end the call

Be polite but don't waste their time with unnecessary chit-chat.
"""
```

---

### 3. Change What Agent Says First

The agent automatically starts speaking based on its instructions. To control the opening:

**Add an initial greeting to the instructions:**
```python
instructions=f"""
You are a health insurance specialist calling clients.

IMPORTANT: When the call connects, immediately greet them by saying:
"Hi {name}, this is [Your Company] calling about your health insurance options. Do you have a minute to chat?"

Then wait for their response before continuing.
...
"""
```

### 4. Adjust Turn Detection Sensitivity (agent.py Line 339)

If the agent interrupts too much or waits too long:

```python
# More sensitive (agent speaks faster after user pauses)
turn_detection=EnglishModel(detection_threshold=0.6),

# Less sensitive (agent waits longer before speaking)
turn_detection=EnglishModel(detection_threshold=0.8),

# Default (currently used)
turn_detection=EnglishModel(),  # threshold=0.7
```

---

### 5. Client Name and Info (agent.py Line 330)

Currently hardcoded:
```python
agent = OutboundCaller(
    name="Jayden",  # Change this or look up from database
    appointment_time="",  # Add appointment time if needed
    dial_info=dial_info,
)
```

---

## Making Changes

**After editing agent.py:**

1. Save the file
2. Restart the local agent:
   ```bash
   # Kill the current agent (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
   # OR if running in background:
   pkill -f "python agent.py"

   # Start it again
   python agent.py start
   ```

3. Make a test call:
   ```bash
   python make_call.py
   ```

## Testing Tips

1. Make small changes one at a time
2. Test each change with a phone call
3. Check the agent logs to see what's happening
4. Iterate based on how the conversation feels

The agent is very flexible - experiment to find what works best for your use case!
