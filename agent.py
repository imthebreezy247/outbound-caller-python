"""
AI Outbound Caller Agent

This agent makes automated phone calls using LiveKit's real-time communication platform.
It uses OpenAI's Realtime API for speech-to-speech communication, providing a natural
conversational experience for appointment confirmations and call management.

Key Features:
- Automated appointment confirmation calls
- Call transfer functionality to human agents
- Voicemail detection
- Appointment scheduling assistance
- Natural voice conversation using OpenAI's Realtime API

Architecture:
- Uses SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) for phone connectivity
- LiveKit for real-time audio streaming
- OpenAI Realtime API for speech-to-speech processing
- Function calling for agent actions (transfer, hangup, etc.)

Note: This agent requires a Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS/WSL2) due to
LiveKit's IPC system requirements. It will not work on Windows/MINGW64.
