# üöÄ HOW TO RUN - AI Outbound Caller

Complete guide to run your AI-powered outbound calling system with voice testing sandbox.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ installed
- Node.js and pnpm installed
- LiveKit account and project set up
- Git Bash or terminal

---

## üéØ Quick Start - 3 Components

You need to run **3 things** to use this system:

1. **The AI Agent (Backend)** - Handles the phone calls
2. **Voice Testing Sandbox (Frontend)** - Test AI voice in browser without phone calls
3. **Dispatch Command** - Actually make phone calls

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ START THE AI AGENT (Always Run First!)

**Terminal 1:**

```bash
cd /d/Coding-Projects/outbound-caller-python
python agent.py start
```

**What you should see:**
```json
{"message": "starting worker", "level": "INFO", ...}
{"message": "registered worker", "id": "AW_xxxxx", ...}
```

**‚úÖ Success:** When you see `"registered worker"` - your agent is ready!

**‚ö†Ô∏è Keep this terminal running!** Don't close it.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ LAUNCH THE VOICE TESTING SANDBOX (Optional - For Testing)

**Terminal 2:**

```bash
cd /d/Coding-Projects/outbound-caller-python/voice-test
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

**What you should see:**
```
‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.x.x
- Local:   http://localhost:3000
```

**‚úÖ Success:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

**Test your AI agent:**
- Click the microphone button
- Start talking to test the AI voice assistant
- No phone calls needed - just browser testing!

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ MAKE ACTUAL PHONE CALLS

### Option A: Using Command Line (Git Bash)

**Terminal 3:**

```bash
cd /d/Coding-Projects/outbound-caller-python

lk dispatch create \
  --new-room \
  --agent-name outbound-caller \
  --metadata '{"phone_number": "+1234567890", "transfer_to": "+0987654321"}'
```

**Replace:**
- `+1234567890` = Phone number to call
- `+0987654321` = Transfer number (optional)

### Option B: Using LiveKit Dashboard (Easier!)

1. Go to: https://cloud.livekit.io/
2. Login and select: **ai-assistant-calling-project**
3. Navigate to: **Agents** ‚Üí **Dispatch** (or **Rooms** ‚Üí **Create Room**)
4. Fill in:
   - **Agent Name:** `outbound-caller`
   - **Metadata:**
     ```json
     {"phone_number": "+1234567890", "transfer_to": "+0987654321"}
     ```
5. Click **Create** or **Dispatch**

**‚úÖ Success:** The phone will ring and the AI agent will start talking!

## üé§ What the AI Agent Does

When someone answers:
- Introduces itself as a dental scheduling assistant
- Tries to confirm an appointment for "Jayden" on "next Tuesday at 3pm"
- Can answer questions about availability
- Can transfer to a human if requested
- Detects voicemail and hangs up

---

## üìä Monitoring & Debugging

### View Live Status
- **Dashboard:** https://cloud.livekit.io/
- **Your Project:** ai-assistant-calling-project
- **Check:** Agents tab to see worker status
- **Monitor:** Rooms tab to see active calls

### Check Logs
Look at Terminal 1 (where agent is running) for real-time logs:
```json
{"message": "connecting to room", ...}
{"message": "participant joined", ...}
```

---

## üõë Stopping Everything

1. **Stop the Agent:** Press `Ctrl+C` in Terminal 1
2. **Stop the Sandbox:** Press `Ctrl+C` in Terminal 2
3. **Calls automatically end** when agent stops

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Main Config File: `.env.local`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
# LiveKit Configuration (Get from https://cloud.livekit.io/)
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
LIVEKIT_SIP_URI=sip:your-sip-uri.sip.livekit.cloud

# OpenAI API Key (Required for Realtime API)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your_openai_key

# SIP Trunk ID (Get from LiveKit dashboard after trunk setup)
SIP_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID=ST_your_trunk_id

# Optional: For alternative STT/TTS providers (if not using Realtime API)
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_key

# Twilio Credentials (For trunk setup only)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
TWILIO_TO_NUMBER=+0987654321
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Agent Won't Start - TimeoutError on Windows/MINGW64
- **Error:** `TimeoutError` during inference executor initialization
- **Root Cause:** LiveKit agents' IPC system doesn't work on Windows/MINGW64
- **Solutions:**
  1. **Use WSL2 (Recommended):** Run the agent in Windows Subsystem for Linux
     ```bash
     # In WSL2 terminal:
     cd /mnt/d/Coding-Projects/outbound-caller-python
     ./start-agent.sh start
     ```
  2. **Use Docker:** Run in a Linux container
  3. **Deploy to Cloud:** Use a Linux server or cloud platform

- **Why this happens:** The inference executor uses Unix sockets for IPC, which aren't fully compatible with Windows

### Can't Make Calls
- **Check:** Is the agent running? (Terminal 1 should show "registered worker")
- **Check:** Is your SIP trunk active? Check dashboard
- **Check:** Do you have Twilio credits?

### Voice Sandbox Not Working
- **Check:** Is the agent running? (Terminal 1)
- **Check:** Did you run `pnpm install` first?
- **Check:** Browser console for errors (F12)

### Command `lk` Not Found
- **Solution 1:** Use the dashboard instead (easier!)
- **Solution 2:** Reinstall LiveKit CLI: `winget install LiveKit.LiveKitCLI`
